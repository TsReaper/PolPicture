# PolPicture
An interesting little project which uses genetic algorithm to make lots of colorful polygons fit a certain picture.

The idea is based on [this blog post](https://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/) and [this website](http://alteredqualia.com/visualization/evolve/).

## Goals
- [x] Write a genetic algorithm to make evolving pictures
- [x] Make a user interface using Flash and ActionScript 3

## Result

The fitness of the first few thousand generations grew quite quickly, after that it gradually became more and more slowly.
